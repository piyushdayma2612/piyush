<h3>Turnkey project Services</h3>
<p>Turnkey project services model comes with the delivery of a project within a limit of cost, time and scope. This model is only viable when the scope is 100% defined and there is no future roadmap or it is not clear. Some cases, there is a dependency on the initial MVP to commit on a long term engagement plan. Fixed cost contract project success also depends on triple constraint (Cost, Scope and time). The entire scope is divided into multiple payment and scope milestones. Each milestone is signed-off before moving to the next milestone. This model is ideal for small sized projects.

<h1>Build Operate Transfer</h1>
<p>Build Operate Transfer model suits you the best if you want to reduce the burdens of heavy stress. Under this engagement model, we help you enhance the project development processes right from scratch. We build the operational frameworks that include infrastructures, resources, and the operational unit itself. This phase of setting up the amenities is known to be the build phase. The operate phase, which succeeds in the build phase consists of developing the project from scratch, project management, enhancements, maintenance, tech support, etc. The last and final phase is the transfer phase where the in and out ownership of the project gets transferred to the client after operating for an agreed duration. Successful completion of the project results in its transfer of ownership. The main reason for considering the BOT model is that it saves a lot of time, effort, and money.</p>
